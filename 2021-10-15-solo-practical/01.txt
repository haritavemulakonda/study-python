You will be operating on the following "data" with regular
expressions.  The lines are numbered, but /do not/ form part of the
data.

00: Beautiful is better than ugly.
01: Explicit is better than implicit.
02: Simple is better than complex.
03: Complex is better than complicated.
04: Flat is better than nested.
05: Sparse is better than dense.
06: Readability counts.
07: Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
08: Although practicality beats purity.
09: Errors should never pass silently.
10: Unless explicitly silenced.
11: In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
12: There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
13: Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
14: Now is better than never.
15: Although never is often better than *right* now.
16: If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
17: If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
18: Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

What lines are matched by the following regular expressions?  If none
match, write nil.

A: /^I/            ----------------------- Line 11,16,17

B: /implementation.*hard/ --------------- Line 16

C: /readability/  ----------------------- Nil


Write a regular expression that matches the given line.  Use the
/minimum/ amount of characters achieve the match, but ensure that only
one line matches.

D: match line 02    -----------------/^Si.*/

E: match line 12   -----------------/--o/

F: match line 06  ------------------- /^R.*/
